# ![Spiritblast Logo](/.github-assets/spiritblast.png) Spiritblast

A mod for ANTONBLAST (vm_public builds), made using GMLoader.

**!! VERY INCOMPLETE AND WIP, DO NOT BOTHER YET !!**

Currently features the following:
* Some basic debug functionality (such as debug collision visibility)

The following is in the YYToolkit iteration of Spiritblast and hasn't been implemented yet:
* Access to the GameMaker debug overlay
* Borderless fullscreen option
* Custom room loading functionality (WIP)

There are a few keys that have been added that do some sort of action:
* **F4** - Toggle debug collision visibility
* **F5** - Change current page in menu

## Install

Make sure you have GMLoader set up with ANTONBLAST.  
This [one](https://gamebanana.com/tools/21913) should work fine, alternatively you can use [my own copy](https://mega.nz/file/vq5TyT7a#9QsH9ADyDqvjqzCOcWNUI6Tzxvl6udWh7yN9hasOeF4) of it, which should be identical to the other one minus some cleanup that I did.

Download this repository and then copy the folders located in the Spiritblast folder into your mods folder.
